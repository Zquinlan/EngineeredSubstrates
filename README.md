# Abstract
The widespread loss of stony reef-building coral populations has been compounded by pervasive recruitment failure, i.e., the low or absent settlement and survival of coral juveniles. To combat global coral reef stressors and rebuild coral communities, restoration practitioners have developed workflows to rear and settle vulnerable coral larvae in the laboratory and subsequently outplant settled juveniles back to natural and artificial reefs. These workflows often make use of the natural biochemical settlement cues present in crustose coralline algae (CCA), which are presented as extracts or fragments to induce larval settlement. In this work, we investigated the potential for inorganic chemical cues to complement these known biochemical effects. We designed settlement substrates made from lime mortar (CaCO3), which is chemically similar to coral skeletons, and varied their composition with the use of synthetic and mineral additives, including sands, glasses, and alkaline earth carbonates. In experiments with larvae of two coral species, Acropora palmata (elkhorn coral) and Diploria labyrinthiformis (grooved brain coral), we saw additive-specific settlement preferences (>10-fold) in the absence of external biochemical cues. Further, these settlement trends were independent of average physical substrate properties such as surface roughness and wettability. Our results suggest that settling larvae can sense and positively respond to soluble inorganic materials and detect localized topographical features that are orders of magnitude smaller than their body width and not currently predicted by Attachment Point Theory. This opens a new area of research in reef restoration, where engineered substrates can be designed with a combination of organic and inorganic additives to increase larval settlement, and perhaps even aid in post-settlement growth, mineralization, and defense.
